A SFZ drum kit modeled after the LinnDrum LM-2

The LinnDrum drum machine was used by many iconic musicians of the 1980s including Trevor Horn, Michael Jackson, and Kate Bush. Its sound is synonymous with the electronic dance pop music of that era. 

BushDrum, named after Kate Bush, is a sfz instrument made from 44.1 kHz samples of the original LinnDrum drum machine. It is very basic, and should work in any SFZ sampler.
